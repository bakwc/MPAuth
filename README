MPAuth - module for ping authorization.
It keeps specified port closed until ping request received.


      Requirements:

 - gcc
 - make
 - linux kernel sources


      Using:

 - ./configure
 - make
 - sudo insmod mpauth.ko filterPort=22 pingPass=123

  filterPort	- port to filter
  pingPass	- ping size

To open port you need to send ping with specified size, e.g.:

  ping your_server -s 123

And you'll have 30 seconds to connect
